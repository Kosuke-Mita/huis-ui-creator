                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is<br>
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

#FFmpeg:<br>
<br>
Most files in FFmpeg are under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1<br>
or later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other<br>
files have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to<br>
FFmpeg.<br>
<br>
Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License<br>
version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of<br>
these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to<br>
configure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.<br>
<br>
Specifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are:<br>
<br>
- libpostproc<br>
- optional x86 optimizations in the files<br>
  - `libavcodec/x86/flac_dsp_gpl.asm`<br>
  - `libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c`<br>
  - `libavfilter/x86/vf_removegrain.asm`<br>
- libutvideo encoding/decoding wrappers in<br>
  `libavcodec/libutvideo*.cpp`<br>
- the X11 grabber in `libavdevice/x11grab.c`<br>
- the swresample test app in<br>
  `libswresample/swresample-test.c`<br>
- the `texi2pod.pl` tool<br>
- the following filters in libavfilter:<br>
    - `f_ebur128.c`<br>
    - `vf_blackframe.c`<br>
    - `vf_boxblur.c`<br>
    - `vf_colormatrix.c`<br>
    - `vf_cover_rect.c`<br>
    - `vf_cropdetect.c`<br>
    - `vf_delogo.c`<br>
    - `vf_eq.c`<br>
    - `vf_find_rect.c`<br>
    - `vf_fspp.c`<br>
    - `vf_geq.c`<br>
    - `vf_histeq.c`<br>
    - `vf_hqdn3d.c`<br>
    - `vf_interlace.c`<br>
    - `vf_kerndeint.c`<br>
    - `vf_mcdeint.c`<br>
    - `vf_mpdecimate.c`<br>
    - `vf_owdenoise.c`<br>
    - `vf_perspective.c`<br>
    - `vf_phase.c`<br>
    - `vf_pp.c`<br>
    - `vf_pp7.c`<br>
    - `vf_pullup.c`<br>
    - `vf_sab.c`<br>
    - `vf_smartblur.c`<br>
    - `vf_repeatfields.c`<br>
    - `vf_spp.c`<br>
    - `vf_stereo3d.c`<br>
    - `vf_super2xsai.c`<br>
    - `vf_tinterlace.c`<br>
    - `vf_uspp.c`<br>
    - `vsrc_mptestsrc.c`<br>
<br>
Should you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)GPL, then<br>
the configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option<br>
for you. Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv3` or, if you have enabled GPL parts,<br>
`COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.<br>
<br>
There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:<br>
<br>
* The files `libavcodec/jfdctfst.c`, `libavcodec/jfdctint_template.c` and<br>
  `libavcodec/jrevdct.c` are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for<br>
  licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the IJG in the<br>
  documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables.<br>
  You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to<br>
  those three files in the documentation.<br>
* `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.<br>
<br>
<br>
external libraries<br>
==================<br>
<br>
FFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes<br>
affect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.<br>
<br>
compatible libraries<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
The following libraries are under GPL:<br>
- frei0r<br>
- libcdio<br>
- librubberband<br>
- libutvideo<br>
- libvidstab<br>
- libx264<br>
- libx265<br>
- libxavs<br>
- libxvid<br>
<br>
When combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by<br>
passing `--enable-gpl` to configure.<br>
<br>
The OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License 2.0. That<br>
license is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with<br>
version 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the<br>
license version needs to be upgraded by passing `--enable-version3` to configure.<br>
<br>
incompatible libraries<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
The Fraunhofer AAC library and FAAC are under licenses which<br>
are incompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. We do not know for certain if their<br>
licenses are compatible with the LGPL.<br>
If you wish to enable these libraries, pass `--enable-nonfree` to configure.<br>
But note that if you enable any of these libraries the resulting binary will<br>
be under a complex license mix that is more restrictive than the LGPL and that<br>
may result in additional obligations. It is possible that these<br>
restrictions cause the resulting binary to be unredistributeable.<br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

Introduction<br>
============<br>
<br>
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>
  FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br>
<br>
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br>
<br>
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br>
<br>
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br>
<br>
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>
      FreeType code. (`credits')<br>
<br>
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a<br>
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus<br>
  encourage you to use the following text:<br>
<br>
   """<br>
    Portions of this software are copyright ã¥ <year> The FreeType<br>
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.<br>

<br>
  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you<br>
  actually use.<br>

<br>
Legal Terms<br>
===========<br>
<br>
0. Definitions<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br>
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br>
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>
  beta or final release.<br>
<br>
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br>
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.<br>
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br>
  engine'.<br>
<br>
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br>
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br>
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br>
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br>
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br>
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.<br>
<br>
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<br>
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as<br>
  specified below.<br>
<br>
1. No Warranty<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,<br>
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<br>
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO<br>
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
2. Redistribution<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and<br>
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,<br>
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and<br>
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code<br>
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to<br>
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted<br>
  herein, subject to the following conditions:<br>
<br>
    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file<br>
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to<br>
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying<br>
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,<br>
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source<br>
      files.<br>
<br>
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br>
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br>
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br>
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br>
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<br>
<br>
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br>
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br>
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br>
  to us.<br>
<br>
3. Advertising<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br>
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>
  purposes without specific prior written permission.<br>
<br>
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br>
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br>
<br>
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>
  of this license.<br>
<br>
4. Contacts<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:<br>
<br>
    o freetype@nongnu.org<br>
<br>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>

<br>
"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM<br>
codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.<br>
<br>
Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,<br>
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to<br>
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise<br>
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where<br>
such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by<br>
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily<br>
infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims<br>
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these<br>
implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order<br>
or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent<br>
enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or<br>
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM<br>
or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM<br>
constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of<br>
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License<br>
for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such<br>
litigation is filed.<br>

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is<br>
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

#FFmpeg:<br>
<br>
Most files in FFmpeg are under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1<br>
or later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other<br>
files have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to<br>
FFmpeg.<br>
<br>
Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License<br>
version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of<br>
these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to<br>
configure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.<br>
<br>
Specifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are:<br>
<br>
- libpostproc<br>
- optional x86 optimizations in the files<br>
  - `libavcodec/x86/flac_dsp_gpl.asm`<br>
  - `libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c`<br>
  - `libavfilter/x86/vf_removegrain.asm`<br>
- libutvideo encoding/decoding wrappers in<br>
  `libavcodec/libutvideo*.cpp`<br>
- the X11 grabber in `libavdevice/x11grab.c`<br>
- the swresample test app in<br>
  `libswresample/swresample-test.c`<br>
- the `texi2pod.pl` tool<br>
- the following filters in libavfilter:<br>
    - `f_ebur128.c`<br>
    - `vf_blackframe.c`<br>
    - `vf_boxblur.c`<br>
    - `vf_colormatrix.c`<br>
    - `vf_cover_rect.c`<br>
    - `vf_cropdetect.c`<br>
    - `vf_delogo.c`<br>
    - `vf_eq.c`<br>
    - `vf_find_rect.c`<br>
    - `vf_fspp.c`<br>
    - `vf_geq.c`<br>
    - `vf_histeq.c`<br>
    - `vf_hqdn3d.c`<br>
    - `vf_interlace.c`<br>
    - `vf_kerndeint.c`<br>
    - `vf_mcdeint.c`<br>
    - `vf_mpdecimate.c`<br>
    - `vf_owdenoise.c`<br>
    - `vf_perspective.c`<br>
    - `vf_phase.c`<br>
    - `vf_pp.c`<br>
    - `vf_pp7.c`<br>
    - `vf_pullup.c`<br>
    - `vf_sab.c`<br>
    - `vf_smartblur.c`<br>
    - `vf_repeatfields.c`<br>
    - `vf_spp.c`<br>
    - `vf_stereo3d.c`<br>
    - `vf_super2xsai.c`<br>
    - `vf_tinterlace.c`<br>
    - `vf_uspp.c`<br>
    - `vsrc_mptestsrc.c`<br>
<br>
Should you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)GPL, then<br>
the configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option<br>
for you. Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv3` or, if you have enabled GPL parts,<br>
`COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.<br>
<br>
There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:<br>
<br>
* The files `libavcodec/jfdctfst.c`, `libavcodec/jfdctint_template.c` and<br>
  `libavcodec/jrevdct.c` are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for<br>
  licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the IJG in the<br>
  documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables.<br>
  You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to<br>
  those three files in the documentation.<br>
* `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.<br>
<br>
<br>
external libraries<br>
==================<br>
<br>
FFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes<br>
affect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.<br>
<br>
compatible libraries<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
The following libraries are under GPL:<br>
- frei0r<br>
- libcdio<br>
- librubberband<br>
- libutvideo<br>
- libvidstab<br>
- libx264<br>
- libx265<br>
- libxavs<br>
- libxvid<br>
<br>
When combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by<br>
passing `--enable-gpl` to configure.<br>
<br>
The OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License 2.0. That<br>
license is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with<br>
version 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the<br>
license version needs to be upgraded by passing `--enable-version3` to configure.<br>
<br>
incompatible libraries<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
The Fraunhofer AAC library and FAAC are under licenses which<br>
are incompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. We do not know for certain if their<br>
licenses are compatible with the LGPL.<br>
If you wish to enable these libraries, pass `--enable-nonfree` to configure.<br>
But note that if you enable any of these libraries the resulting binary will<br>
be under a complex license mix that is more restrictive than the LGPL and that<br>
may result in additional obligations. It is possible that these<br>
restrictions cause the resulting binary to be unredistributeable.<br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Introduction<br>
============<br>
<br>
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>
  FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br>
<br>
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br>
<br>
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br>
<br>
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br>
<br>
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>
      FreeType code. (`credits')<br>
<br>
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a<br>
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus<br>
  encourage you to use the following text:<br>
<br>
   """<br>
    Portions of this software are copyright ã¥ <year> The FreeType<br>
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.<br>
   """<br>
<br>
  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you<br>
  actually use.<br>
<br>
<br>
Legal Terms<br>
===========<br>
<br>
0. Definitions<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br>
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br>
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>
  beta or final release.<br>
<br>
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br>
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.<br>
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br>
  engine'.<br>
<br>
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br>
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br>
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br>
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br>
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br>
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.<br>
<br>
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<br>
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as<br>
  specified below.<br>
<br>
1. No Warranty<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,<br>
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<br>
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO<br>
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
2. Redistribution<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and<br>
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,<br>
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and<br>
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code<br>
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to<br>
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted<br>
  herein, subject to the following conditions:<br>
<br>
    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file<br>
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to<br>
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying<br>
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,<br>
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source<br>
      files.<br>
<br>
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br>
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br>
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br>
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br>
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<br>
<br>
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br>
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br>
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br>
  to us.<br>
<br>
3. Advertising<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br>
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>
  purposes without specific prior written permission.<br>
<br>
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br>
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br>
<br>
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>
  of this license.<br>
<br>
4. Contacts<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:<br>
<br>
    o freetype@nongnu.org<br>
<br>
      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as<br>
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.<br>
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you<br>
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.<br>
<br>
    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org<br>

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
		       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>

That's all there is to it!<br>

<br>
"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM<br>
codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.<br>
<br>
Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,<br>
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to<br>
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise<br>
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where<br>
such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by<br>
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily<br>
infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims<br>
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these<br>
implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order<br>
or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent<br>
enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or<br>
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM<br>
or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM<br>
constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of<br>
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License<br>
for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such<br>
litigation is filed.<br>

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is<br>
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>

                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>

#FFmpeg:<br>
<br>
Most files in FFmpeg are under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1<br>
or later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other<br>
files have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to<br>
FFmpeg.<br>
<br>
Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License<br>
version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of<br>
these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to<br>
configure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.<br>
<br>
Specifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are:<br>
<br>
- libpostproc<br>
- optional x86 optimizations in the files<br>
  - `libavcodec/x86/flac_dsp_gpl.asm`<br>
  - `libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c`<br>
  - `libavfilter/x86/vf_removegrain.asm`<br>
- libutvideo encoding/decoding wrappers in<br>
  `libavcodec/libutvideo*.cpp`<br>
- the X11 grabber in `libavdevice/x11grab.c`<br>
- the swresample test app in<br>
  `libswresample/swresample-test.c`<br>
- the `texi2pod.pl` tool<br>
- the following filters in libavfilter:<br>
    - `f_ebur128.c`<br>
    - `vf_blackframe.c`<br>
    - `vf_boxblur.c`<br>
    - `vf_colormatrix.c`<br>
    - `vf_cover_rect.c`<br>
    - `vf_cropdetect.c`<br>
    - `vf_delogo.c`<br>
    - `vf_eq.c`<br>
    - `vf_find_rect.c`<br>
    - `vf_fspp.c`<br>
    - `vf_geq.c`<br>
    - `vf_histeq.c`<br>
    - `vf_hqdn3d.c`<br>
    - `vf_interlace.c`<br>
    - `vf_kerndeint.c`<br>
    - `vf_mcdeint.c`<br>
    - `vf_mpdecimate.c`<br>
    - `vf_owdenoise.c`<br>
    - `vf_perspective.c`<br>
    - `vf_phase.c`<br>
    - `vf_pp.c`<br>
    - `vf_pp7.c`<br>
    - `vf_pullup.c`<br>
    - `vf_sab.c`<br>
    - `vf_smartblur.c`<br>
    - `vf_repeatfields.c`<br>
    - `vf_spp.c`<br>
    - `vf_stereo3d.c`<br>
    - `vf_super2xsai.c`<br>
    - `vf_tinterlace.c`<br>
    - `vf_uspp.c`<br>
    - `vsrc_mptestsrc.c`<br>
<br>
Should you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)GPL, then<br>
the configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option<br>
for you. Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv3` or, if you have enabled GPL parts,<br>
`COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.<br>
<br>
There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:<br>
<br>
* The files `libavcodec/jfdctfst.c`, `libavcodec/jfdctint_template.c` and<br>
  `libavcodec/jrevdct.c` are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for<br>
  licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the IJG in the<br>
  documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables.<br>
  You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to<br>
  those three files in the documentation.<br>
* `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.<br>
<br>
<br>
external libraries<br>
==================<br>
<br>
FFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes<br>
affect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.<br>
<br>
compatible libraries<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
The following libraries are under GPL:<br>
- frei0r<br>
- libcdio<br>
- librubberband<br>
- libutvideo<br>
- libvidstab<br>
- libx264<br>
- libx265<br>
- libxavs<br>
- libxvid<br>
<br>
When combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by<br>
passing `--enable-gpl` to configure.<br>
<br>
The OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License 2.0. That<br>
license is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with<br>
version 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the<br>
license version needs to be upgraded by passing `--enable-version3` to configure.<br>
<br>
incompatible libraries<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
The Fraunhofer AAC library and FAAC are under licenses which<br>
are incompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. We do not know for certain if their<br>
licenses are compatible with the LGPL.<br>
If you wish to enable these libraries, pass `--enable-nonfree` to configure.<br>
But note that if you enable any of these libraries the resulting binary will<br>
be under a complex license mix that is more restrictive than the LGPL and that<br>
may result in additional obligations. It is possible that these<br>
restrictions cause the resulting binary to be unredistributeable.<br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

Introduction<br>
============<br>
<br>
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>
  FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br>
<br>
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br>
<br>
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br>
<br>
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br>
<br>
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>
      FreeType code. (`credits')<br>
<br>
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a<br>
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus<br>
  encourage you to use the following text:<br>
<br>
   """<br>
    Portions of this software are copyright ã¥ <year> The FreeType<br>
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.<br>

<br>
  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you<br>
  actually use.<br>

Legal Terms<br>
===========<br>
<br>
0. Definitions<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br>
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br>
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>
  beta or final release.<br>
<br>
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br>
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.<br>
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br>
  engine'.<br>
<br>
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br>
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br>
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br>
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br>
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br>
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.<br>
<br>
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<br>
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as<br>
  specified below.<br>
<br>
1. No Warranty<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,<br>
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<br>
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO<br>
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
2. Redistribution<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and<br>
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,<br>
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and<br>
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code<br>
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to<br>
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted<br>
  herein, subject to the following conditions:<br>
<br>
    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file<br>
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to<br>
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying<br>
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,<br>
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source<br>
      files.<br>
<br>
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br>
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br>
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br>
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br>
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<br>
<br>
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br>
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br>
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br>
  to us.<br>
<br>
3. Advertising<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br>
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>
  purposes without specific prior written permission.<br>
<br>
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br>
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br>
<br>
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>
  of this license.<br>
<br>
4. Contacts<br>

<br>
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:<br>
<br>
    o freetype@nongnu.org<br>
<br>
      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as<br>
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.<br>
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you<br>
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.<br>
<br>
    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org<br>

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
		       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>

"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM<br>
codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.<br>
<br>
Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,<br>
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to<br>
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise<br>
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where<br>
such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by<br>
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily<br>
infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims<br>
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these<br>
implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order<br>
or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent<br>
enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or<br>
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM<br>
or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM<br>
constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of<br>
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License<br>
for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such<br>
litigation is filed.<br>

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is<br>
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

     #  A large portion of the dictionary entries<br>

     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.<br>
     #<br>
     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its<br>
     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED<br>
     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear<br>
     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially<br>
     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended<br>
     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise<br>
     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having<br>
     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.<br>
     #<br>
     #  NO WARRANTY<br>
     #<br>
     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the<br>
     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided<br>
     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the<br>
     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,<br>
     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein<br>
     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,<br>
     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of<br>
     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of<br>
     #  any right of any third party.<br>
     #<br>
     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to<br>
     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for<br>
     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or<br>
     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.<br>
     #<br>
     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other<br>
     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the<br>
     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,<br>
     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all<br>
     #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental<br>
     #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection<br>
     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material<br>
     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,<br>
     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had<br>
     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the<br>
     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the<br>
     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term<br>
     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,<br>
     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the<br>
     #  production of secondary products from the program.<br>
     #<br>
     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or<br>
     #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from<br>
     #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or<br>
     #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in<br>
     #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted<br>
     #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted<br>
     #  above as far as the program is concerned.<br>

    5. Time Zone Database<br>
<br>
      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone<br>
    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database<br>
    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone<br>
    Database section 7.<br>
<br>
     # 7.  Database Ownership<br>
     #<br>
     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF<br>
     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br>
     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the<br>
     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do<br>
     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make<br>
     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ<br>
     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA<br>
     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of<br>
     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance<br>
     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made<br>
     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person<br>
     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to<br>
     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

<br>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
    Preamble<br>
<br>
    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software<br>
    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.<br>
    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic<br>
    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the<br>
    Package available as open source and free software.<br>
<br>
    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this<br>
    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the<br>
    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to<br>
    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek<br>
    a different licensing arrangement.<br>
<br>
    Definitions<br>
<br>
        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)<br>
        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.<br>
<br>
        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other<br>
        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's<br>
        procedures.<br>
<br>
        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,<br>
        distribute, or modify the Package.<br>
<br>
        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the<br>
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of<br>
        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard<br>
        Version, or a Modified Version.<br>
<br>
        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it<br>
        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or<br>
        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.<br>
<br>
        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing<br>
        this Package or providing support for this Package to another<br>
        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.<br>
<br>
        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been<br>
        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested<br>
        by the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and<br>
        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright<br>
        Holder.<br>
<br>
        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with<br>
        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as<br>
        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.<br>
<br>
        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and<br>
        configuration files for the Package.<br>
<br>
        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,<br>
        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or<br>
        translation of the Source form.<br>
<br>
    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br>
<br>
    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use<br>
    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that<br>
    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.<br>
<br>
    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version<br>
<br>
    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the<br>
    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,<br>
    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate<br>
    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At<br>
    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a<br>
    Compiled form of the Package.<br>
<br>
    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other<br>
    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting<br>
    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such<br>
    will be subject to the Original License.<br>
<br>
    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source<br>
<br>
    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis<br>
    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the<br>
    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs<br>
    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting<br>
    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that<br>
    you do at least ONE of the following:<br>
<br>
        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder<br>
        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the<br>
        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard<br>
        Version.<br>
<br>
        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not<br>
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In<br>
        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different<br>
        from the name of the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to<br>
        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others<br>
        under<br>
<br>
            (i)  the Original License or<br>
<br>
            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,<br>
            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same<br>
            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee<br>
            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified<br>
            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely<br>
            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor<br>
            Fees are allowed.<br>
<br>
    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version<br>
    or Modified Versions without the Source<br>
<br>
    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without<br>
    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to<br>
    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be<br>
    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any<br>
    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you<br>
    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.<br>
    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty<br>
    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then<br>
    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.<br>
<br>
    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without<br>
    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to<br>
    the Source of the Modified Version.<br>
<br>
    Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>
<br>
    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or<br>
    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting<br>
    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the<br>
    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other<br>
    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license<br>
    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions<br>
    as included in the aggregation.<br>
<br>
    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with<br>
    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to<br>
    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that<br>
    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,<br>
    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.<br>
<br>
    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>
<br>
    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that<br>
    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause<br>
    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not<br>

    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any<br>
    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily<br>
    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation<br>
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging<br>
    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent<br>
    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the<br>
    date that such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>

      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

We put together a small chart of as many possibilities and questions we have heard from people asking how they may use Openclipart. If you have an additional question, please email love@openclipart.org.<br>

Each artist at Openclipart releases all rights to the images they share at Openclipart.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
   1. Definitions.<br>
<br>

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br>
<br>
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<br>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>
<br>
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<br>
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>
<br>
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br>
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br>
      source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
      and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
<br>
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br>

<br>
ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE>(TM), and CoSMIC(TM) (henceforth referred to<br>
as "DOC software") are copyrighted by Douglas C. Schmidt and his research<br>
group at Washington University, University of California, Irvine, and<br>
Vanderbilt University, Copyright (c) 1993-2009, all rights reserved. Since DOC<br>
software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to use,<br>
modify, copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software<br>
source code and object code produced from the source, as well as copy and<br>
distribute modified versions of this software. You must, however, include this<br>
copyright statement along with any code built using DOC software that you<br>
release. No copyright statement needs to be provided if you just ship binary<br>
executables of your software products.<br>
You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are<br>
under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built<br>
using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC<br>
software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the<br>
DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being<br>
distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform<br>
anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage<br>
you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success<br>
stories.<br>
<br>
The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC<br>
Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center<br>
for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the<br>
development of open-source software as part of the open-source software<br>
community. Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no<br>
warranties whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability,<br>
noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any<br>
particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct,<br>
indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including<br>
without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such<br>
damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any<br>
kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a<br>
particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing,<br>
usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt<br>
University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect<br>
to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC<br>
software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington<br>
University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students<br>
be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, indirect and<br>
consequential damages.<br>
<br>
DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the<br>
part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their<br>
employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or<br>
enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support<br>
for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the<br>
underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant<br>
with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy<br>
Act of 2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the<br>
United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains<br>
time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be<br>
affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems<br>
accordingly.<br>

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>

      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
